# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline for the Cloud Health Dashboard application using AWS CodeCommit and AWS CodePipeline. The system will automate the build, test, and deployment process for both the backend (Python FastAPI) and frontend (React) applications.

## Glossary

- **CodeCommit**: AWS managed source control service that hosts Git repositories
- **CodePipeline**: AWS continuous delivery service for automating release pipelines
- **CodeBuild**: AWS fully managed build service that compiles source code and runs tests
- **Backend Application**: Python FastAPI application located in the `backend/` directory
- **Frontend Application**: React application located in the `frontend/` directory
- **Build Artifact**: Compiled and packaged application ready for deployment
- **Deployment Stage**: Phase in the pipeline where the application is deployed to target environment
- **Pipeline**: Automated workflow that builds, tests, and deploys code changes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate my code from a local Git repository to AWS CodeCommit, so that my source code is stored in AWS and can trigger automated pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer initializes CodeCommit repository, THE System SHALL create a new repository with the name "cloud-health-dashboard"
2. THE System SHALL configure Git credentials for HTTPS access to the CodeCommit repository
3. THE System SHALL provide instructions to migrate existing Git history to CodeCommit
4. THE System SHALL preserve all existing branches and commit history during migration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up a CodeBuild project for the backend application, so that the Python FastAPI application can be automatically built and tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source code changes are detected, THE Backend Build Project SHALL install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
2. THE Backend Build Project SHALL execute unit tests if test files exist in the backend directory
3. THE Backend Build Project SHALL package the application into a deployable artifact
4. IF the build fails, THEN THE Backend Build Project SHALL report detailed error messages in the build logs
5. THE Backend Build Project SHALL use Python 3.9 or higher runtime environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up a CodeBuild project for the frontend application, so that the React application can be automatically built and optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source code changes are detected, THE Frontend Build Project SHALL install Node.js dependencies from package.json
2. THE Frontend Build Project SHALL execute the build script to create production-optimized static files
3. THE Frontend Build Project SHALL output build artifacts to a designated S3 bucket or artifact store
4. IF the build fails, THEN THE Frontend Build Project SHALL report detailed error messages in the build logs
5. THE Frontend Build Project SHALL use Node.js 18 or higher runtime environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a CodePipeline that orchestrates the entire CI/CD workflow, so that code changes automatically flow through build, test, and deployment stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commit is pushed to the main branch, THE Pipeline SHALL automatically trigger the build process
2. THE Pipeline SHALL execute the backend build stage before the frontend build stage
3. THE Pipeline SHALL include a source stage that pulls code from CodeCommit
4. THE Pipeline SHALL include separate build stages for backend and frontend applications
5. IF any stage fails, THEN THE Pipeline SHALL stop execution and notify the development team

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline to deploy the backend application to an appropriate compute service, so that the FastAPI application is accessible to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend build succeeds, THE Pipeline SHALL deploy the application to the target environment
2. THE Pipeline SHALL support deployment to either EC2, ECS, or Elastic Beanstalk
3. THE Pipeline SHALL update environment variables from configuration files during deployment
4. THE Pipeline SHALL perform health checks after deployment to verify application availability
5. IF deployment fails, THEN THE Pipeline SHALL rollback to the previous stable version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline to deploy the frontend application to S3 and CloudFront, so that the React application is served with high performance and availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend build succeeds, THE Pipeline SHALL upload static files to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
2. THE Pipeline SHALL invalidate CloudFront cache after deployment to serve updated content
3. THE Pipeline SHALL set appropriate cache headers for static assets
4. THE Pipeline SHALL configure the S3 bucket with proper CORS settings for API communication
5. THE Pipeline SHALL enable HTTPS access through CloudFront distribution

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure IAM roles and policies for the pipeline, so that CodePipeline and CodeBuild have appropriate permissions to access AWS resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL create an IAM role for CodePipeline with permissions to access CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and S3
2. THE System SHALL create an IAM role for CodeBuild with permissions to write logs and access build artifacts
3. THE System SHALL follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions
4. THE System SHALL document all IAM roles and their associated policies
5. WHERE deployment to EC2 or ECS is required, THE System SHALL include appropriate deployment permissions in IAM roles

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive notifications about pipeline execution status, so that I am informed of successful deployments or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pipeline execution completes successfully, THE System SHALL send a notification to the configured SNS topic or email
2. WHEN a pipeline execution fails, THE System SHALL send a detailed failure notification with error information
3. THE System SHALL support integration with SNS for notification delivery
4. THE System SHALL include pipeline name, stage, and execution ID in notifications
5. WHERE email notifications are configured, THE System SHALL send notifications to the developer's email address

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want buildspec files for both applications, so that CodeBuild knows how to build and test each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL create a buildspec.yml file in the backend directory with build commands for Python application
2. THE System SHALL create a buildspec.yml file in the frontend directory with build commands for React application
3. THE Backend Buildspec SHALL include phases for install, pre_build, build, and post_build
4. THE Frontend Buildspec SHALL include phases for install, pre_build, build, and post_build
5. THE Buildspec files SHALL define artifact outputs for deployment stages

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want infrastructure-as-code templates for the entire CI/CD setup, so that the pipeline can be recreated or modified consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide CloudFormation or Terraform templates for all pipeline resources
2. THE Templates SHALL include parameters for customization of repository names, branch names, and deployment targets
3. THE Templates SHALL create all required IAM roles, policies, and service configurations
4. THE Templates SHALL be modular to allow separate deployment of backend and frontend pipelines
5. THE Templates SHALL include outputs with important resource identifiers and endpoints
